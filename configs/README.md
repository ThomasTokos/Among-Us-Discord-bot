# Among Us Discord Bot Configs

## default.config.ts
The default config is used for managing the bot.
You can change the commands, prefixes, and the activity string

## development.config.ts
This config is for when you are testing the bot.
We use a separate token than the production one because the build might not be stable or we are trying to debug.

## production.config.ts
This is the config file that will be built into the bot when you run `npm run build`.
This is the config file for your bot so please make sure you have all of the correct information.
